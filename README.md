# Hello John!

How are you doing? I've heard you're having a bit trouble to staying organized lately because you've been very busy. So I've gone head and put together a To-do's List to assist you in managing your daily tasks.

Here is the link:
[Buzzvel's Todo](https://buzzvels-todo.vercel.app/)

# Let me introduce the app for you
When you open the app, you will see the home screen with a message saying `There is no tasks yet.`\

## Task oversight
You can toggle the task status between done and to-do.\

In the right section you will find:
- a small badge indicating the deadline date for your task.
- a subtasks button.

If the task does have subtasks, the button color will be more brightly colored.\

## End date warning

I provided warnings when the task's end date is near but the task remains to be done. Here is some scenarios where these warning come into play:

**When you have only one day left to complete the task, but It still to be done.**\

**When you have two days remaining to complete the task, but It still to be done.**\

**When you have at least one day remaining to complete the task, but you managed to complete it on time.**\

## Sorting
You can sort the tasks based on these criterias, by `Done`, Text, and Date (created at, and expires at).\
<img src="https://github.com/vitormarkis/buzzvels-todo/assets/121525239/a7cdc940-5a73-4a12-9d7f-bee1401f399e" alt="drawing" width="600" />

All the possible sortings are:
- Done first
- To be done first
- Created at (ascending)
- Created at (descending)
- Expires at (ascending)
- Expires at (descending)
- Text (ascending)
- Text (descending)

To see the sorting arrangement, click on the `Sorting` button, that will open a small box displaying the current sorting status, allowing you to easily keep track of how your tasks are organized.
